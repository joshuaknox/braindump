There is much furor around the explosive growth of mobile and I believe that there's more froth than substance.

For most users, the difference between a traditional computer and a mobile device may not be noticeable.  Notably, both Neil Gaiman and Barack Obama are Blackberry users, I suspect because they both value the keyboard.

Power-users find the constraints imposed by mobile devices (especially Apple ones) undesirable.

A significant amount of commerce (apparently ~$230B world-wide) occurs on mobile devices, and I expect that will continue to grow.

I also expect that my life-time mobile spend on goods will be roughly $0.  Services are another story entirely, although I'm skeptical that I'll be a regular user of anything other than transportation and concierge services.

I'm not a representative user, so it's possible I'm just woefully out of touch with the shopping habits of my fellow millenials.

It's also possible that the world's current largest company by market cap (Apple, which I expect to be losing that title soon, but that's another post) is profoundly fucked if mobile doesn't end up mattering tremendously more than it currently does.  

Apple is currently effectively a 3-product company: mobile devices (iPhone, Apple Watch, arguably iPad), computers (mostly MacBooks), and iTunes.  Apple fanboys might well point out that the App Store is significant, though I think it properly is part-and-parcel of the iPhone.  

Apple doesn't have a chance in hell of significantly growing their marketshare in the personal computer market and the prospects for iTunes are not great. Tim Cook basically has to bet it all on the iPhone, which involves significant ad spend to attempt to ensure that people think that particular pile of silicon is culturally significant[1].

The financial incentives for proclaiming mobile The Next Big Thing[2] dwarf the financial incentives for not[3], and a small number of successful mobile-first companies have made the opportunity prominent in our cultural awareness.  Barring outrageous advances in UI (eg, direct neural interfaces) or questionable accounting (eg, counting NFC payments with a phone as mCommerce) I don't believe mCommerce will ever equal or surpass eCommerce for goods.  mCommerce may end up more significant than traditional eCommerce by virtue of winning services: it'll be interesting to see.

[1] I won't dispute the claim that the iPhone was a revolutionary piece of technology, but it got leap-frogged by Android devices in a big way, with only Apple Pay as a recent "innovation".  

[2] Off hand: Apple, Samsung and every other smartphone manufacturer

[3] Off hand: literally no company.
