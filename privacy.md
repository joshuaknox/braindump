I have tremendous respect for Edward Snowden - he took a principled stand in a reasonable manner, and I believe that the impact of that stand has been largely positive.

That said, I think that the arguments around privacy are largely missing the tradeoffs.

It is true that allowing an entity to know more about you can potentially give them leverage or a more effective means to hurt you.  

Yet, somehow, most people make that decision several (perhaps dozens, hundreds, or even thousands) of times over the course of their lives by establishing relationships with other humans.  

One could reasonably object that those relationships are opt-in and that a citizen's relationship with their government is less so.

My answer to that is that while there are repressive regimes that do not allow their populace to leave their borders, the US is sufficiently far from that state that I am not concerned.  Were I told that I could not leave my nation's borders, I would be outraged, and I believe justly so.  

Two qualifying questions occur to me: 
1.  Why should governments need to monitor anything at all?
2.  What about extra-national monitoring?

Governments (or some other largely benevolent entity) need to monitor people because the impact of an action may not be well-understood.

Notably, this is buying the conceit that people are largely good, which I'm still unsure of. I'm less interested in making the case for governments in the presence of Evil, however, so I'll go with it.
questions:
1. Should a citizen be able to opt out of providing their child with education?
2. Should a citizen be able to opt out of immunization, for themselves or their child?
3. Should an entity be allowed to burn coal?
4. Should a citizen be allowed to smoke cigarettes?

Most reasonably well informed individuals would agree that at least some of those things are "bad", but are they so bad that they can't be allowed?

The options as I see it are:
1. Answer those questions with an uninformed opinion
2. Answer those questions with an informed opinion

The datasets involved in these sorts of questions can be staggeringly large, or need to be collected over many years, or both.  

I can't think, offhand, of an example of an impassioned individual pursuing these sorts of questions without (possibly indirect) government funding and being able to disseminate the message effectively without government involvement.

This is not to say that it's never happened, or never will happened, merely that for "turns out we were wrong about that", governments are likely to get involved.

Governments are, generally, much worse at operating in the small: "save the X" initiatives seem to start with citizens and some get elevated to the level of government involvement.

In short, there are some important questions that self-serving entities (most individuals and corporations) may never get around to asking.  I posit that governments play an important role in pursuing these questions and that they need large datasets in order to conduct the investigations appropriately.

It's probably worth noting at this point that I'm opposed to dragnet data collection of things like phone calls.  

I'm opposed not because absolute power corrupts absolutely, or because I believe I have an inalienable right to not be overheard, but because I call bullshit on the dataset being useful for actually serving the public good.  Sentiment analysis is a sufficiently hard problem, and most conversations sufficiently worthless that it seems a colossal waste. 

On the subject of extranational monitoring: that gets murky fast. The benevolent paternalism required of government seems likely to hit a scale limit, and in my ideal world the "need" would be solved via international cooperation.
