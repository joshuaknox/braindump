I'm an existential-risk-from-AI skeptic and recently thought of an interesting rationale for that opinion.

The reason that biological life works is that some molecular configurations are both 
* A) (comparatively more) stable, and 
* B) energetically achievable.

(this is a simplification)

Barring radically different hardware, computer-based life-forms have some pretty tough sledding.  To my knowledge, there's no real physical enforcement that allows a particular set of bit-states to be more stable than another with fewer active bits.

Ok, but does that matter? After all, for strong AI to function on current hardware it (effectively) requires uninterrupted power (possibly across multiple hosts).  

I think it *does* matter, because it means that there's a strong pressure towards non-existence.  Moreover, I think it makes the potential for incremental evolution effectively non-existent.

There are a couple of reasonable counter-arguments:
* Humans will (inadvertently) provide the islands of stability that allow viable computational life-forms to emerge
* The threat of Strong AI may not require a computational life-form to be realized

The latter is effectively indistinguishable from "faulty software poses an existential threat to humanity".  This is potentially true, but I don't think AI is required (though it might make it easier by increasing the "surface area" for faults).

The former is, I suspect, bullshit. In order for it to be true, there needs to be some configuration of bits that:
* we haven't yet achieved
* is somehow capable of calculated reproduction 

"calculated reproduction" is important - a hypothetical ice-nine bit-state (or family of bit-states) would just cause faults.  

Computer viruses/worms are a potential example, but they stack up...poorly to biological life in any reasonable extant comparison. 

Fine, what about a software/hardware hybrid (self-replicating machines as typified by "gray goo", android apocalypse, etc.)?

Frankly, I think we'd need to be a hell of a lot better at both manufacturing and AI.
